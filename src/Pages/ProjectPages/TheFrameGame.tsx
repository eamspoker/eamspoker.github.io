The project focused on creating and maintaining a database of frame semantic annotations. They wanted find a way of gathering and verifying user-generated annotations.", "I started off by reviewing a variety of papers. These papers varied from very specific (papers detailing how the FrameNet database works or focused on FrameNetâ€™s previous crowdsourcing efforts) to very broad (papers that focused on frame semantics in general or crowdsourcing in general). This gave me a good idea of the different options available in the space of crowdsourcing. These included microwork (compensating workers for small tasks on an online platform), hosting the task on a citizen science platform, or creating a game to crowdsource annotations. Below is an example of some of the summaries and notes I made based on the papers.", "", "", "After researching, I explored most of the options I uncovered in my survey of the literature. The exception was microwork, which had previously been explored by the FrameNet project. During discussions with the head of the project, we decided that we wanted to create a method of crowdsourcing that centered user involvement and excitement about research. Unfortunately, many citizen science platforms were set up for natural science classification tasks or historical text transcription. Thus, we decided to implement a game where the user wrote and annotated stories. The goal of this game was to transparently crowdsource novel annotations for FrameNet while teaching them something about frame semantics. I then created a basic high visual and interaction fidelity prototype of the game using Unity.", "Being a part of a research program, I had the opportunity to summarize my work in a poster and presentation session. With the support of the FrameNet project, I was able to write a short paper to submit to the Data Science with Human-in-the-Loop: Language Advances workshop at the Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing Conference. I was then able to attend the conference and present my work thanks to the support of the research program. Through all of these communication opportunities, I learned how to communicate my research process and findings in an effective manner.", "", ""];
